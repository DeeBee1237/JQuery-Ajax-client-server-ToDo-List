# JQuery-Ajax-client-server-ToDo-List

This app uses Jquery and Ajax to allow clients to create a to-do list, where all the tasks are stored on an actuall server 
(hosted on learn code academy). Clients can add new tasks to the list, and remove tasks once they are done. All data is updated
and stored on the server.
